Creating the IDE project
------------------------

InteliJ
cd ~/<checkout dir>/page-objects
./gradlew idea

Open the generated page-objects.ipr file and you're good to go. All your dependencies will be automatically resolved and ready to use.

Eclipse
cd ~/<checkout dir>/page-objects
./gradlew eclipse



If you want to update the version of Selenium or TestNG you are using just update the version numbers in build.gradle and rerun the above commands to regenerate your project.



Running the tests via the IDE
-----------------------------
You will need TestNG plugin installed for your IDE

Right click on the test and select 'run' or 'debug'

Running the tests using Gradle
------------------------------

Required:
Java and Gradle installed

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
https://gradle.org/install

Unless you have Gradle installed, you'll need to use the Gradle wrapper which is included in the project
./gradlew or gradle.bat on Windows

To run all tests:
Mac/Unix run:
./gradlew clean build allLoginTests



Windows:
gradlew.bat clean build allLoginTests

Note: Iâ€™ve not tested this myself because I do not have access to the Windows machine at the moment, but it should work
